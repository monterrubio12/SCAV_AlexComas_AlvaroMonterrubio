# SCAV_AlexComas_AlvaroMonterrubio
This is the repository where we will be creating a software for SCAV practices at UPF.

## Seminar 1
During this first seminar on video coding in the SCAV course, we will implement a script named `first_seminar`that includes various classes and methods for processing images using the ffmpeg library, along with other libraries for image and data processing such as scipy, numpy, and pillow. In this seminar, we will not only work with image manipulation we also deal with some of the core principles of image and video encoding and compression algorithmsâ€”essential tools for media transmission and storage.
